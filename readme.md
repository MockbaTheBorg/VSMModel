##VSMModel

This is a very simple VSM implementation, of a 2 input AND port.
The purpose of this project is simply to create a functional VSM model which can be built upon to create other, more complex, VSM emulation components.

This project is only for a digital model.

##Building

To build, just open the project on VS2015 and hit "Build". It should build with no errors.

##Testing

A simple design, called TestJig, is included, to test the built .DLL.
